# Remwaste React Challenge

## About the Project

I started the project with Vite and React Router, and used Tailwind CSS for styling. I chose not to use any component library or advanced router/data frameworks because I wanted to focus on building the page myself instead of relying too much on external libraries.

I paid attention to the folder structure to make the project easy to scale and maintain. For code formatting and linting, I used Prettier and ESLint to keep the code clean and readable.

The steps are simulated using navigation from the homepage. I used localStorage to pretend that the user already completed the previous steps. For global state, I used Zustand with persist support.

Since the API you provided didn't include images, I extracted real skip images from your original website and manually added them to the data (merged them with the API data) instead of using random placeholder images.

I also added a sorting feature to the skip selection page.

## To improve the developer experience:

- I used absolute imports to avoid long relative paths.
- I Dockerized the project, but didn't add Docker Compose since it's a single-app project.
- The `.env.example` file includes `VITE_API_URL` with the given API base.
